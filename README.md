# Police-Weather-Data-Integration

This repository showcases a data engineering project integrating police stop records with weather data to analyse correlations between weather conditions and traffic violations.

## Project Overview

- **Data Sources**: Police stop records and historical weather data
- **Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Key Features**:
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Temporal alignment and merging
  - Feature engineering for weather impact analysis

## Key Findings

- **Weather Impact**: "Bad" weather conditions correlate with increased speeding violations
- **Temporal Patterns**: Most weather-related stops occur during rush hours

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Raw and merged datasets
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for each step
- **src/**: Utility functions and validation scripts
- **docs/**: Data dictionary and methodology documentation
- **images/**: Plots and visualizations

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run notebooks in sequence for full analysis
